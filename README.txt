The folders contain the potential energy and dipole moment single points for the individual conformers of each alcohol. These single points are used in the paper: "Effect of Eckart Embedding on Vibrational Intensities". The calculations are all done using the z-matrices given in the supporting information of the article.

1D files:

First column contains the displacements of the respective coordinate (see file name; "Coordinate.dat").

The second to fourth column contains the dipole moment, for the given displacement, in the x,y, and z direction, respectively.

The fifth (last) column contains the potential energy for the given displacement calculated at the CCSD(T)-F12a/VDZ-F12 level of theory.

2D files:

The first two columns contain the displacements of the respective coordinates (see file name; "Coordinate1-Coordinate2.dat").


The third to fifth column contains the dipole moment, for the given displacement, in the x,y, and z direction, respectively.

The sixth (last) column contains the potential energy for the given displacement calculated at the CCSD(T)-F12a/VDZ-F12 level of theory.
